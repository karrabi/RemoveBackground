Create a simple HTML file with the following requirements:

Image Selection:

Include a button that allows the user to select an image file.
Display the selected image on the page.


API Interaction:

Include a button that sends the selected image to the Flask API endpoint at http://localhost:5000/remove-background.
Upon clicking the button, display a loading indicator to the user.


Processed Image Display:

After the API processes the image and returns the result, display the processed image on the page.


Error Handling:

If there is an error while processing the image, display an appropriate error message to the user.


Styling:

Apply a clean, modern design to the HTML page.
Ensure the layout is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
